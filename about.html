              The Jagadguru Veerasimhaasana Peetha was established in the 11th Century A.D. at Sutturu by Adi Jagadguru Sri Shivarathreeshwara Shivayogi Mahaswamiji. Sutturu is a village in Nanjangud taluk, Mysuru District in Karnataka. It is about 28 km from Mysuru city, in the south-east direction. The Peetha with its high ideals has been making remarkable contributions in religious, social, educational, and economic spheres in the state and across the country. It is striving for social development by responding to community needs. It strongly believes that unless the problems of the socially backward communities and the poor are taken care of, there will not be social development. With this objective, the math has initiated several programmes, while at the same time living up to its principle of “work is worship” and is engaged in raising public awareness on issues of social concern.
